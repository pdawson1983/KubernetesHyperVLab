| Task                                               | Priority | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enrich observability: structured tool/turn data    | Medium   | Agents currently write timing + status. Next: structured summary block per run with turns used, tool call sequence — feeds self-improvement loop queries. |
| System self-improvement loop                       | High     | `system.improve` event routes to architect with this repo as target; architect reads observability DB to identify inefficiencies in agent-base.md / CLAUDE.md files; ops opens a PR with proposed changes. Requires observability data layer first. Add to TRIGGER_MAP.                             |
| Build web UI + Postgres                            | Medium   | Task submission UI (MD upload + guided form); Postgres backend shared with observability layer. Build together — same DB deployment covers both.                                                                                                                                                    |
| WSL route: add WSL-restart trigger                 | Medium   | Validated 2026-05-10: task WSL-K8s-Route exists, runs at logon, cluster reachable. Gap: WSL mid-session restart drops route — workaround: `schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\\WSL-K8s-Route"`. Fix: add WSL-restart trigger.                                                                                  |
| Add human approval gate between Reviewer and Ops   | Low      | Web UI manages approvals — queue-watcher pauses at reviewer→ops; ops job fires only after user approves in UI. Depends on web UI build.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Add GitHub webhook integration                     | Low      | Real repo events → pipeline trigger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Add Tekton for more complex pipeline orchestration | Low      | Current CronJob-as-template pattern has limits at scale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
